Dev notes : 

discord clone using python3


l_server.py -> contains the code for lobby servers 
a_server.py -> code for the authentication server 
client.py 



roadblocks:

[] - create or find a barebones client which can make VoIP calls 
[] - create an interface for making these calls
[] - enable other features like group calls 
[] - add chat lobbies 
[] - enable a friends feature
